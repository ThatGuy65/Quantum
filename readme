For this project, i plan to pick back up my research into Quantum Music Making, via the use of a recurrent neural network if possible. 
I will be using alot of the knowledge gained  in this course to augment my project, such as the qubit and leveraging qBraid's capabilities 
I will need to somehow use the concept of quantum superposition to simulte the randomness that procedurally generated songs can provide 
In order to do this, I will mke use of the content provided in the conversation seen here:

I will also be make use of some of the research papers preseneted here:
